# class-of-2023

# 📃 Description
A website for the graduating Class of 2023. The data for this website was collected through Google Forms, which were linked to Google Sheets. Attached to Google Sheets were Google Scripts, which I quickly realised is essentially JavaScript with a built-in API that integrates with Google Sheets seamlessly. The data was then cleaned, standardised and analysed using Google Scripts (again, a superset of JavaScript). The findings were made available as JSON through a single API endpoint. The website was built using React.js and TailwindCSS.
